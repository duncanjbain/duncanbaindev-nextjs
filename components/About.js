      {' '}
      In Spring 2019 I decided to make a change, a change in my career as a
      Mechanical Engineer to become a Software Engineer. I&apos;ve always been
      interested in computers, having been introduced to them at a young age, I
      even went on to study Computer Science for a year before changing to
      Mechanical Engineering! Now after spending the last 8 years working in
      various engineering roles I&apos;ve decided to make the change.
    </p>
    <p className="articleP">
      I&apos;m now spending the majority of my free time learning HTML, CSS and
      JavaScript with the intention of gianing a solid foundation of fullstack
      web development.
    </p>
    <p className="articleP">
      When not coding I enjoy cycling, cooking and travelling.
